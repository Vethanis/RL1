test ECS a bunch

add qu3e physics or similar, ensure it uses our transform and not its own internal one

enable some sort of parallel update phase for components that can take advantage of it

make a function to draw each entity

implement thread and semaphores

names.h/cpp are weird. archetype system instead? need a spot to declare some sort of plato apple so that resources can try to create a shadow of one
needs to be compatible with procedural generation and world tiles
