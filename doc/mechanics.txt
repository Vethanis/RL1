proposed mechanics and ideas:

    DOOM roguelike, where possession is the core mechanic.

    Start as a disembodied spirit wandering in a dark fog, occasionally stumbling into 
    posessable characters.

    Upon posession, you have little to no control over the character, but gradually gain
    influence over where the character goes and what the character does.

    Eventually you gain full control, the character is effectively a zombie that groans
    as you force it to do your bidding.

    If you weaken another character to a certain degree, you may attempt to possess that 
    other character, losing the stats stored in your previous character but carrying over
    augmentations to your spirit.

    Character progression is capped, but spirit progression is not.

    Each character has a different starting and ending ability capacity,
    which is the reason why you would want to possess a defeated character.
